     * TO IMPLEMENT
     * CanvasRect constructor makes a new rectangle on the canvas.
     * Note that the bound needs to be calculated by finding the minimum
     * and maximum x and y coordinates from mStart and mEnd. Also note that
     * ShapeFactory may be able to help you.
     * paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL) will fill any rectangle you draw.
     * paint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE) mean only an outline is drawn.
     * @param mStart: the touch down event point
     * @param mEnd: the touch up event point
     * @param color: The color of the oval (integer)
     * @param brush: the width of the oval outline
     * @param fill: boolean whether the oval is filled in or not.
